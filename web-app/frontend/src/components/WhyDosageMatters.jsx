    <h2>‚ùì Why Does Dosage Matter?</h2>
    <p>
      Applying the right amount of biofertilizer is crucial for both crop health and environmental sustainability:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Too much:</b> Wastes resources and can cause microbial competition</li>
      <li><b>Too little:</b> Leads to ineffective results and poor crop performance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      EcoDose helps you find the <b>sweet spot</b> using real soil data, maximizing both effectiveness and sustainability.
