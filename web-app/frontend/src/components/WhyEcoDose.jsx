      <h2>ðŸŒ± Why EcoDose?</h2>
      <p>
        As first-year engineering students passionate about sustainability and technology, we noticed a big gap in how biofertilizers are used. Farmers either overdose or underdose due to guesswork, especially with microbial fertilizers like Rhizobium.<br /><br />
        We thought: <b>What if AI could bridge that gap?</b><br />
        EcoDose was born â€” a project to recommend the right quantity of biofertilizer based on actual soil conditions.<br /><br />
        It started as an Idea Lab project, but we quickly realized it had real-world potential â€” especially in regions like Karnataka where Rhizobium-based fertilization is common but not optimized.
