      <h2>ðŸŒ± Why EcoDose?</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to EcoDose! We're a team of passionate first-year engineering students on a mission to make sustainable agriculture smarter and easier for everyone.<br /><br />
        We noticed a big gap in how biofertilizers are usedâ€”farmers often overdose or underdose due to guesswork, especially with microbial fertilizers like <b>Rhizobium</b>.<br /><br />
        <b>What if AI could bridge that gap?</b><br />
        That's how EcoDose was born: a project to recommend the right quantity of biofertilizer based on your actual soil conditions.<br /><br />
        What started as an Idea Lab project quickly showed real-world potentialâ€”especially in regions like Karnataka, where Rhizobium-based fertilization is common but not yet optimized.
