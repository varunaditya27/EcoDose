      <h2>ðŸŒ± Why EcoDose?</h2>
      <p>
        Agriculture is changing â€” and so are the challenges. While synthetic fertilizers dominate the fields, they're often misused, misunderstood, and environmentally costly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Microbial biofertilizers</strong> like <strong>Rhizobium</strong> offer a smarter, greener solution â€” but only if used correctly. And thatâ€™s where most farmers struggle: <em>How much is too much? Is this soil even ready?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thatâ€™s where EcoDose steps in. We use AI to recommend just the right amount of biofertilizer â€” based on <em>your unique soil parameters</em> â€” so you get maximum yield with minimal waste.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're a student, researcher, or farmer â€” EcoDose brings clarity to the chaos of soil management, and turns guesswork into green growth.
