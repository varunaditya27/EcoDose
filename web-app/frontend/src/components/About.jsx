        <h2>ðŸŒ± About EcoDose</h2>
        <p>
          EcoDose is an AI-powered microbial biofertilizer assistant designed to revolutionize sustainable agriculture. 
          Built by a passionate team of first-year engineering students at RVCE, EcoDose combines biotechnology, machine learning, 
          and intuitive design to provide optimized dosage recommendations of Rhizobium-based biofertilizers for leguminous crops.
        </p>
        <p>
          By leveraging real-time soil input such as <strong>pH</strong>, <strong>moisture</strong>, and <strong>NPK levels</strong>, 
          our system intelligently predicts the right amount of biofertilizer to apply â€” maximizing crop yield while minimizing waste.
        </p>
