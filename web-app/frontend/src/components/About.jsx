      <h2>ðŸ“š Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          EcoDose is a full-stack solution that bridges biotechnology and AI to solve one of agricultureâ€™s most overlooked challenges: optimizing biofertilizer application. 
          Developed as part of RVCEâ€™s <strong>Experiential Learning program</strong>, our system blends real-time sensor data, machine learning predictions, and user-friendly design into one platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          By leveraging real-time soil input such as <strong>pH</strong>, <strong>moisture</strong>, and <strong>NPK levels</strong>, 
          our system intelligently predicts the right amount of biofertilizer to apply â€” maximizing crop yield while minimizing waste.
        </p>
