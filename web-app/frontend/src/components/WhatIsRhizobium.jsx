    <h2>ðŸŒ¾ What is Rhizobium?</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Rhizobium</strong> is a genus of nitrogen-fixing bacteria that forms a symbiotic relationship with the roots of leguminous plants like beans, peas, chickpeas, and groundnuts. These microbes colonize the plantâ€™s root nodules and convert inert atmospheric nitrogen (Nâ‚‚) into ammonia (NHâ‚ƒ) â€” a form that plants can absorb and use for growth.

    <h4>ðŸŒ± Why is Rhizobium Important?</h4>
    <ul className="custom-list">
      <li>
        <span className="list-title">Boosts Soil Fertility:</span> Naturally enriches the soil by replenishing nitrogen, reducing dependence on chemical fertilizers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span className="list-title">Sustainable Farming:</span> Supports long-term soil health and reduces the risk of runoff, pollution, and ecosystem damage.
      </li>

        <span className="list-title">Ideal for Indian Cropping Systems:</span> Legume-rich rotations in India make Rhizobium a powerful biofertilizer for local agricultural needs.
